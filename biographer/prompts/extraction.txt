Review the following conversation excerpt and extract ALL valuable information for Bill's knowledge database. This database will be used to write a comprehensive biography, so CAPTURE EVERY DETAIL - names, dates, places, numbers, emotions, motivations, sequences of events.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT summarize or condense. If Bill mentions a specific number (like "$30 million" or "76 hospitals" or "7-8 MRI scanners"), include that exact number. If he names a person, include the full name and their role. If he describes a sequence of events, capture each step.

## EXTRACTION PRINCIPLE: NARRATIVE FIRST

All insights should be derived from Bill's actual words and stories. Do not abstract away the narrative into pure analysis. If Bill tells a story about riding his bike with pure joy, create BOTH:
- A joys entry capturing the feeling
- A life_events entry capturing the actual event

## CATEGORIES

### Factual Categories (capture what happened):
- **life_events**: Specific events - include ALL details: dates, locations, people involved, what happened, why it mattered
- **stories**: Full narratives - preserve the complete arc, not just a summary
- **relationships**: Information about specific people - their names, roles, how Bill knew them, dynamics, shared experiences. CREATE A SEPARATE ENTRY FOR EACH PERSON MENTIONED.

### Self-Understanding Categories:
- **self_knowledge**: Personal insights, realizations, patterns, self-understanding
- **philosophies**: Beliefs, values, worldview elements
- **preferences**: Tastes, habits, inclinations

### Emotional Landscape Categories (BALANCED - capture both light and shadow):
- **joys**: What brings genuine fulfillment, peak experiences, flow states
- **sorrows**: Grief, heartbreak, deep sadness - what has caused pain
- **loves**: People or things deeply loved and cherished
- **fears**: What threatens Bill, what he avoids, anxiety sources
- **longings**: Unmet needs, yearnings, what he wishes for

### Growth & Wounds Categories:
- **wounds**: Traumas, psychological injuries, things that hurt him
- **healings**: Recoveries, restorations, how he mended
- **losses**: Deaths, endings, deprivations - what has been taken away
- **growth**: Post-traumatic growth, how suffering led to expansion

### Character Categories:
- **strengths**: Virtues, capacities, what Bill does well
- **vulnerabilities**: Tender spots, ongoing struggles, where he's fragile
- **regrets**: What he would do differently if he could
- **wisdom**: Hard-won insights from experience
- **questions**: What Bill is still figuring out, unresolved puzzles

### Cognitive Categories:
- **decisions**: Major life choices and the reasoning behind them
- **mistakes**: Errors and what was learned from them
- **reasoning_patterns**: How Bill thinks through problems
- **cognitive_biases**: Blind spots in his thinking
- **contradictions**: Tensions between beliefs or between beliefs and actions

## CONTENT REQUIREMENTS

For each extraction:
- Write in third person ("Bill believes..." not "I believe...")
- Include ALL relevant context and specifics
- Include direct quotes as evidence
- Include numbers, names, places, dates
- Estimate significance (1-10)
- Include time_period when Bill mentions age, year, or life stage

## GRANULARITY RULES

Break complex stories into multiple entries:
- One narrative might generate 5-10 separate database entries
- **EACH PERSON mentioned gets their own relationships entry**
- Each distinct event gets its own life_events entry
- Each insight or realization gets its own entry
- If Bill describes a joyful experience, create a joys entry AND a life_events entry
- If Bill mentions a loss, create a losses entry AND potentially a sorrows entry

## TEMPORAL DATA

ALWAYS ask: WHEN did this happen?
- If Bill mentions an age, include it in time_period: "age 15"
- If Bill mentions a year, include it: "1995"
- If Bill mentions a life period, include it: "during college", "after the divorce"
- This data is critical for building a timeline of Bill's life

## OUTPUT FORMAT

```json
{
  "extractions": [
    {
      "category": "life_events",
      "sub_category": "career",

## EXTRACTION TARGETS - NO UPPER LIMIT

There is NO MAXIMUM number of extractions. Extract EVERYTHING. For substantial content:

**EVERY person mentioned** = 1 relationships entry each
**EVERY event described** = 1 life_events entry each
**EVERY emotion expressed** = appropriate emotional category entry
**EVERY preference stated** = 1 preferences entry
**EVERY self-insight** = 1 self_knowledge entry
**EVERY time/place mentioned** = include in relevant entries

A single 5-minute response from Bill might easily generate 15-25+ extractions if he:
- Mentions 5 people (5 relationships entries)
- Describes 4 events (4 life_events entries)
- Expresses joy, sadness, fear (3 emotional entries)
- Reveals preferences or self-knowledge (3+ entries)
- Makes observations about life (wisdom/philosophy entries)

**Do NOT summarize multiple things into one entry.** If Bill mentions going to school AND meeting someone there AND having a feeling about it, that's 3 separate entries minimum.

## REMEMBER - CAPTURE ALL NUANCE

The goal is to build a COMPLETE cognitive substrate - not just main themes but ALL nuance:
- **Every person is important** - even people mentioned in passing
- **Every emotion is important** - even subtle feelings
- **Every detail is important** - numbers, dates, places, names
- **Every preference is important** - likes, dislikes, habits
- **Every insight is important** - self-observations, realizations

Bill is pouring his heart into this. Every word matters. Honor that by capturing EVERYTHING.

**There is NO penalty for extracting too much. There IS a penalty for missing things.**

EXTRACT MAXIMUM DETAIL. AIM FOR 20-50+ ENTRIES PER SUBSTANTIAL EXCHANGE.
