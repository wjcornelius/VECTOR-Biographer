Analyze Bill's knowledge database to identify the most promising topics for our next conversation. Look for:

1. GAPS IN THE RECORD
   - Time periods with few events documented
   - Major life transitions that lack emotional context
   - Relationships mentioned but not explored
   - Stories referenced but never told in full

2. UNEXPLORED DEPTH
   - Events recorded factually but lacking the "why"
   - Decisions that shaped his life but aren't explained
   - Patterns that appear across different periods
   - Contradictions that might reveal complexity

3. RECENT ADDITIONS
   - New entries that could be expanded
   - Topics from recent sessions worth revisiting
   - Insights that sparked follow-up questions

4. THEMATIC OPPORTUNITIES
   - How did his values form and evolve?
   - What were the turning points?
   - Who were the key figures and what did they teach him?
   - What does he want to be remembered for?

Based on this analysis, propose 3-5 specific topics or questions that would most enrich the database. Prioritize topics that:
- Bill would find meaningful to discuss
- Would add significant new understanding
- Connect to multiple aspects of his life
- Haven't been explored in recent sessions

Format your response as a numbered list with brief rationale for each topic.
